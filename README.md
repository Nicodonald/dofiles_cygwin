My configs for vim, git, tmux, and a plethora of BASH stuff.

# Requirements

Depending on the install options you pick you'll need git and additionally

If you choose to install vim configs:
* Vim 7.4+ (7.3 if you don't want line numbers and relative line numbers at the same time like I do)

If you choose to install my tmux configs:
* python and pip (On Ubuntu 14.04 you may into an ImportError bug, if so see this [LaunchPad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-pip/+bug/1306991#yui_3_10_3_1_1427949292045_394) link for a workaround)
* tmux 1.9a (This will be distro dependent so you'll have to install it yourself. If you stay on 1.8 you'll get weirdness, just upgrade)

* Powerline in ~/repos
* antigen in ~/antigen
* zsh
